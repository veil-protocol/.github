# VEIL Logo Concepts

## Brand Essence

**What VEIL stands for:**
- Information-theoretic privacy (mathematical certainty, not assumptions)
- Layered protection (DC-net → Mix → PIR)
- Invisibility/undetectability
- Distributed trust (no single point of failure)
- Shielding metadata, not just content

**Visual metaphors:**
- Veil/fabric (obscuring, flowing, protective)
- Layers (depth, composition)
- Lattice/mesh (cryptographic structure, distributed)
- Negative space (what's hidden matters)
- Gradient opacity (visible → invisible)

## Concept 1: Layered V

Three offset planes forming a V shape, representing the three core layers (DC-net, Mix, PIR) and information-theoretic depth.

## Concept 2: Veil Flow

Abstract flowing lines suggesting fabric that obscures—the shape resolves into a V when viewed as negative space.

## Concept 3: Distributed Shield

A V constructed from distributed nodes/points, suggesting threshold cryptography and no central point of failure.

## Concept 4: Opacity Gradient

A solid V that fades from visible to invisible, representing undetectability.

## Concept 5: Negative Space Lock

A V formed by the negative space between two shapes, suggesting that what's hidden (the space) is protected.
